# AirBnB clone - The console

The goal of the project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the AirBnB website. The console is the first stage of the project that consists of:

- Create your data model
- Manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
- Store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)

## Whatâ€™s a command interpreter?

A command interpreter is the part of a computer operating system that understands and executes commands that are entered interactively by a human being or from a program. In some operating systems, the command interpreter is called the shell.

## How to start the console:

```bash
$ ./console.py
```

## Usage

It should work like this in interactive mode:

```python
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  count  create  destroy  help  quit  show  update

(hbnb)
(hbnb)
(hbnb) quit
$
```

And in non-interactive mode:

```python
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
$
```
